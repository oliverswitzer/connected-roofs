					<h3>What is the gateway and how does it work?</h3>
					<p>The gateway is a small hardware device connected to an antenna that creates a wireless network for devices that use <a href="https://www.helium.com/" target="_blank">The Helium network</a>. Think of it like a Wi-Fi router, but for devices sending small amounts of data over long ranges. These devices are part of what's usually called the IoT — or the “Internet of Things.”</p>
				</footer>
				<footer id="what-kind-of-hotspots" class="major container medium">
					<h3>What kinds of devices does the gateway help connect?</h3>

					Common IoT devices that can benefit and actually use our network are all around you! Got a smart fridge? Yep, we connect that. Do you use a dog collar that helps track where your pet is? Our network helps that function as well.</p>
				</footer>
				<footer id="security" class="major container medium">
					<h3>Are you sure the network is secure?</h3>
					<p>Our gateways use state-of-the-art, encrypted IoT technology. Only devices on the LoRa network can connect to them - like smart water meters, climate sensors, etc. Laptops, TV’s, and cell phones cannot connect to our gateways, and therefore cannot transfer data through them. Security is our #1 priority.</p>
				</footer>
				<footer id="power" class="major container medium">
					<h3>How much electricity or internet does a gateway use?</h3>
					<p>Our gateways use as much electricity as a 5W LED lightbulb, and as much data as someone who streams a movie or two every month (around 20GB per month)</p>
				</footer>
				<footer id="anything-else-to-do" class="major container medium">
					<h3>Are you sure there's nothing else I have to do?</h3>
					<p>Other than letting us into your building in order to mount the antenna, nothing! On rare occasions we may need access to check on the hotspot if it goes down. However, we have not needed this for any of the hotspots we have installed so far, and it’s very rare for these hotspots to need manual attention once they're setup!</p>
				</footer>
				<footer id="look-like" class="major container medium">
					<h3>What does it look like?</h3>
					<p>Here's an example! Note that they can vary in appearance & mounting style depending on your location. We will try to minimize its appearance and adjust it asthetically to your needs.</p>
